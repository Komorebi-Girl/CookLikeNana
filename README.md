# Cook With Nana
![alt text](src/components/Images/logo.png)
Cook With Nana is a web application that enables users to hire a local grandmother to prepare home cooked meals and provide fun culinary instruction. 

## Planning
The concept comes from sites like Care.com that match people up with baby sitting professionals. Instead, novice cooks and experienced home chefs in their retirement years can connect and explore new culinary horizons together. In the design process, the overall focus was to make something easy and efficient as possible. <br><br>
 The [Wireframes](https://app.moqups.com/loyola2015/gnwBA9BcaA/view) where done on Moqups.com. 

 ## How It Works
### Signing up as a grandma that wants to teach:
- After the user has read all about how the app works, she can sign up. 
- Then, the user will have access to viewing her profile and changing her availabilities around.
- Once someone books an appointment with her, it will be reflected on her scheduling page.
- She can then discuss the logistics with the users that have hired her, such as whether or not she can get transportation, where they will meet up, etc.

### Signing up as a student:
- Users can browse for grandmothers who are available for sessions on their preferred dates in their location.
- Once the user finds someone who specializes in what they are seeking to learn, they book an appointment which will appear on their "My Schedules" page as well.
- After this, they can e-mail the grandma to talk through the logistics with her.

 ## Technologies used
 The front-end was done primarily in React framework and Webpack. Custom CSS components were taken from [React Carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel), [React-Hamburger](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu) [React Video Cover](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-video-cover) and [React Parallax](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-scroll-parallax) 
 Our back-end was done via: MySQL, Axios and Passport (for authentication)

 ## Future Development
 There are a number of features we would like to add to Cook With Nana over time. One particular goal we have is to create both a notification system and in-app messaging system for users. We would also like to incorporate in-app payments in order to ensure grandmas are receiving payments for their services. Due to strict time-restraints, these features weren't included in the first version of this app but would certainly be vital for the application's publication.
  Outside of the application's development, we would also need to include some form of background check to ensure the safety of both parties (instructors and students), as well as implement a way to check food is being prepared in accordance with health standards.
