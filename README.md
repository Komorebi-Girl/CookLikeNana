# Cook Like Nana
![alt text](src/components/Images/logo.png)
Cook With Nana is a web application that enables users to hire a local grandmother to prepare home cooked meals and provide fun culinary instruction. 

## Planning
The concept comes from sites like Care.com that match people up with baby sitting professionals. Instead, young generations and experienced cooks in their retirement years can connect and learn off of each other. In the design process, the overall focus was to make something easy and efficient as possible. <br><br>
 The [Wireframes](https://app.moqups.com/loyola2015/gnwBA9BcaA/view) where done on Moqups.com. 

 ## How It Works
### Signing up as a grandma that wants to teach:
- After the user has understood how the app works, she can sign up. 
- After this, the user will have access to viewing her profile and changing her availabilities around
- Once someone books an appointment with her, it reflects her scheduling page
- She then can communicate with the user the logistics, such as whether or not she can get transportation, where they will meet, etc.

### Being a learner
- User browse people who are open to certain dates/locations
- Once the user finds someone who specializes in what they are seeking to learn, they book an appointment, which will also appear in their schedules page
- After this, they can e-mail the grandma to set up logistics with her

 ## Technologies used
 The front-end was done primarily in React framework and Webpack. Custom CSS components were taken from [React Carousel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel), [React-Hamburger](https://github.com/negomi/react-burger-menu) [React Video Cover](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-video-cover) and [React Parallax](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-scroll-parallax) 
 Our back-end was done via: MySql, Axios and Passport (for authentication)

 ## Future Reiterations
 In development, our goal is to create more notifications and in-app messaging between users. In-app payments in order to track and ensure grandmas are being paid would also be another important part to add into the app. Due to time-restraints in development, these features weren't included but would be vital for the app's publication.
  Outside of the application's development, we would also need to focus on doing background checks of users for their safety, as well as implement a way to check on food services.
